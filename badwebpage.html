                <h1>Reasons why the webpage is bad</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The textboxes do not resize with the screen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The pause/play animation button is not close to the animation
                        so it is hard to figure out what is being paused
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The formatting is messy
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is too much text on different topics on the screen at once
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The screen is full of buttons and links mixed with text that does 
                        not contain links so it is hard to tell if something is a link or not
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The links have various effects making it confusing what will happen. 
                        Some scroll to another part of the page, some link to connected websites, 
                        some open a new tab, and some change the tab.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The animation has a very low frame rate
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Most of the screen is an empty background
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Some links are meant only for studens without indicating it
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Text of various font sizes and black highlights make the words hard to read
                    </li>
                </ul>
