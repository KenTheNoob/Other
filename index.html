					<p>	&emsp;&emsp;My name is Kenneth Cheng. I am a sophomore at NJIT and am majoring in
						computer science. I am from Roselle Park and am dorming at Laurel Hall. 
						So far I have learned Python and Java and hope to learn C++ for more efficient 
						video game development. My favorite subjects are computer science
						(obviously), math, and physics. This is because I find these subjects the most 
						useful in my everyday life. Alongside IT, I am currently taking Psychology, 
						General Chemistry II, Introduction to Computer Science II, and Calculus IIIA. 
						During my free time at NJIT, I usually play video games such as Genshin Impact 
						and Smash Bros or watch anime.
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;&emsp;While my hobbies are usually short-lived, some things I have dabbled
						in are ping-pong, Rubix's Cubes, and card throwing. My favorite food is dumplings
						and my favorite snacks are sour patches and cheez-its. I play the piano
						and alto-saxophone with one of my favorite songs being Megalovania.
						In order to stay in shape, I make sure to do pushups and sit-ups every day. I 
						view myself as an introvert who usually likes to avoid standing out. This is my 
						first online webpage, so Hello World!
